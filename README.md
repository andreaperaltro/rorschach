This book is a creative exploration of perception, psychology, and the interplay between human intuition and artificial intelligence. Inspired by the iconic Rorschach inkblot test, it delves into the contrasts and similarities between human and AI interpretations of abstract visuals. By generating 100 unique, AI-created inkblots and analyzing their interpretations through both human perception and AI reasoning, the project seeks to uncover the subjective and objective layers of meaning we assign to images.

Beyond analysis, this book invites readers to actively engage with the images, challenging themselves to uncover what they see and comparing their interpretations to those of the AI. Through this participatory element, it highlights the unique creativity and biases inherent in both human and machine perspectives. Blending art, technology, and psychology, this work not only examines the nature of perception and creativity but also encourages readers to reflect on their own ways of seeing, sparking deeper questions about the intersection of human and artificial intelligence in interpreting the world around us.
